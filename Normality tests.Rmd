## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(ggpubr)#For visuals
library(dplyr)

#Import data
# Store the data in the variable my_data
my_data <- ToothGrowth
#Dimensions and sample
set.seed(1234)
dplyr::sample_n(my_data, 10)

```

Visual methods of determining normality
```{r}
#Simple plot
ggdensity(my_data$len, 
          main = "Density plot of tooth length",
          xlab = "Tooth length")

#Q-Q plot - Correlation between normal dist and sample
ggqqplot(my_data$len)


```


Statistical tests of normality
The null hypothesis of these tests is that “sample distribution is normal”. If the test is significant, the distribution is non-normal.
```{r}
shapiro.test(my_data$len)
#Data is not significantly different from normality - we can assume normality
